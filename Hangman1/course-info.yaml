summary: 'Games can help you kill time when you’re bored - and here we don’t mean
  smartphone games, but the classic paper-and-pencil ones. However, we aren’t inviting
  you to kill time: on the contrary, we offer to write a game and improve your programming
  skills. In this project, you will work on the Hangman, a game where the player is
  supposed to guess a word letter by letter. Make a program that plays Hangman with
  you - and good luck with the guessing!<br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org">https://hyperskill.org/projects/69</a>'
